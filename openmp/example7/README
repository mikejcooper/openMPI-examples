In this directory we find some example programs that make use of new
features available in OpenMP 4.0.

A number of useful documents for further reading are on openmp.org:

To compile the programs below, you will need the Intel compiler.  I would
recommend thye following module:
  module add languages/intel-compiler-16

To run the code on an accelerator, you'll need access to an Intel accelerator
(xeon-phi aka MIC).  You can get an interactive session on a node equiped with
an appropriate accelerator by typing:
  qsub -q testq -I -l nodes=1:ppn=16:xeon-phi
 
query
=====

This program discovers the number of threads on the host and any accelerator
devices that may exist.

saxpy-serial
============

Serial code to compute the saxpy (constant times a vector, plus a vector)
operation.

saxpy-mic
=========

OpenMP 4.0 code to compute the saxpy (constant times a vector, plus a vector)
operation, with offload to a accelerator (MIC).
