example1:  "Hello, world" code for MPI.
example2:  First, pointo-to-point, message passing examples. 
	   An example of some deadlocking (blocking MPI_Recv) code is included.
example3:  Numerical integration examples, which highlight choice of cohort size.
example4:  Examples contrasting blocking and non-blocking function calls.
example5:  Collective communication.
example6:  Making composite messages to send (possibly to reduce traffic).
example7:  MPI file I/0.
example8:  One-sided (RMA) communications.
example9:  Multiple communicators.
example10: Spawning new processes on the fly.
example11: Communication pattern skeletons including an example HALO EXCHANGE.
