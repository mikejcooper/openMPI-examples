Welcome to the MPI programming examples!

In this directory we start, again, with "hello, world."
MPI libraries can be used with several languages.  Here
we have programs written in C, C++, Fortran77 and Fortran90.

**NB**  Loading multiple MPI related modules could cause
unpredictable behaviour and runtime errors (as mpirun from
one module can end up being called with executables created
with compilers from another).

For simplicity just load the modules associated with one
of the compilers below, at any one time, e.g.

For the GNU compiler:
  module add openmpi/gcc/64/1.6.5
  module add tools/gnu_builds/tau-2.23.1-openmpi

For the Intel compiler:
  module add openmpi/intel/64/1.6.5
  module add tools/intel_builds/tau-2.23.1-openmpi

Compiler independent:
  module add intel-cluster-studio/vtune/vtune-2015

If you wish to experiment with the Intel MPI libraries,
take note of the following:
- You will need to load an Intel compiler module as well
  as the MPI module, e.g.
    module add intel-cluster-studio/compiler/64/13.1/117
    module add intel-mpi/64/4.1.0/024
- Use mpicc to invoke the GNU compiler, linking with the
  Intel (MPICH-based) MPI library.
- Use mpiicc to invoke the Intel compiler, linking with
  the Intel (MPICH-based) MPI library.
